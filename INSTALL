-> If you don't have imake/xmkmf, see item (A) below.

1. Xse comes with a GNU autoconf-generated configure script that
   will hopefully configure the distribution for your system
   automatically. Complete generic details for running the script
   are contained in the file INSTALL.GNU. Basically, you should run
   the script by doing
	% sh ./configure
   to create the config.h file. This file is used both by C files and
   by the Imakefile. You can edit it by hand to change anything that
   the script got wrong (see (B), below).

   Note: if you use "strange" compiler (that isn't cc or gcc), you
   should set the environment variable CC appropriately before running
   configure. Otherwise it will get things that require compilation
   wrong.

   If running configure yields sed errors, you need a newer version of
   sed, like maybe GNU sed.

2. Execute
   	% xmkmf
   to create the Makefile. Alternatively,
        % imake -DUseInstalled -I/usr/local/lib/X11/config
   where the directory given with "-I" is where your Imake.tmpl and
   Imake.rules live. If you have neither xmkmf nor imake, see (A)
   below. 

3. Execute
	% make depend
   to add the dependencies to the Makefile. This is only necessary if
   you change any of the files, including the app-defaults file Xse.ad
   or the manpage. Note that if you change Xse.ad you will need
   "ad2c" and if you change the manpage you will need to be able to run
   the shell scripts "help-text[12].sh".

4. Make the package using
	% make
   You can try xse without installing it, provided that the
   fallback resources have been compiled in using ad2c.

   To experiment with different resource settings without recompiling,
   edit Xse.ad and then do:
	% ln -s Xse.ad Xse
	% setenv XAPPLRESDIR $cwd
   If you have a previous version of xse installed, you will need
   to do
	% setenv XFILESEARCHPATH $cwd
   to prevent the old app-defaults (in the standard place, presumably,
   since you installed them) from conflicting. Your mileage will vary
   on this depending on your version of X.

5. Install the package using
	% make install install.man
   This will install the xse executable, the app-defaults file,
   and the manpage.

NOTE: The Imakefile provides the target "World", which does the following:
	% make -n World
	make Makefile
	make Makefiles
	make depend
	make clean
	make


A. If you don't have imake/xmkmf, you'll have to work with the file
   Makefile.dst. You should copy Makefile.dst to Makefile, and then
   edit it to set the definitions of XINCS, XLIBS, etc., to reflect
   the peculiarities of your X installation.

   After that, try simply "make" (or "make -f Makefile.dst" if you
   didn't copy it to Makefile). If there are problems, go through
   the Makefile using the instructions in item (C) below (for
   Imakefiles) as a guide. Most things are similar. NOTE: Without,
   imake, Makefile.dst cannot use C preprocessor directives to
   configure itself based on the config.h file created by the
   configure script. You will have to adjust definitions accordingly,
   using the values in config.h (for your system!) as a guide.

B. Running the configure script will generate a file "config.h" from
   the template "config.h.in". It may not get everything right for
   your system. If it doesn't, you'll have to edit "config.h" and
   make the required changes. Each definition has a short comment
   indicating the conditions under which it should be defined.

   Be sure to run xmkmf/imake again after changing it.

C. The Imakefile uses definitions in "config.h" to setup a Makefile
   that is correct for your system. In addition, there are several
   parameters that you can change by editing the Imakefile directly,
   although you shouldn't need to do so.

   Note that the Imakefile uses the notation "/**/#" for comments --
   the "/**/" is for cpp (so the "#" isn't interpreted as a
   directive), the "#" is for make. You need to delete both parts to
   "uncomment" a definition, unless it is explicitly indicated that
   the "#" should be left for cpp (as in "#define").

   o Set BINDIR, LIBDIR, and MANDIR if needed to change where the
     stuff goes on "make install" and "make install.man".
   o Xse uses the "ad2c" program to compile-in a set of default
     resources. You should get a copy of ad2c in this distribution,
     otherwise you may have to adjust the definition of AD2C. To not
     compile-in any fallback resources, comment out the #include of
     Xse.ad.h in file xse.c (see comments there).
   o Change CDEBUGFLAGS as appropriate to override the default
     debugging or optimization levels. You might also want to add a
     definition of CC, or you can type "make CC=gcc", for example.

   Finally, you may want to change defaults in Xse.ad. In
   particular, you should set the default archie host as appropriate
   for your location, and possibly the hostWeights also. See the man
   page for details, and see the Imakefile regarding "ad2c".
