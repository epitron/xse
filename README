DISCLAIMER:

     This is release 2.1 of xse -- an interface to XSendEvent().

     This software is provided as is with no warranty expressed or
     implied. I hope you find it useful, but I won't be held
     responsible for any damage that may occur from reading,
     compiling, installing, using, or even thinking about it.

     You are free to use any parts of the code that I wrote for other
     purposes. It would be nice if you could keep my name on some part
     of whatever the final product is.

OVERVIEW:

     Xse provides an interface to XSendEvent(); sort of an inverse of
     xev(1). It provides three interfaces depending on how it is
     invoked. If the -file option is given, the events are read from
     the specified file and sent to the proper window (either the
     default or the one given by the "-window" argument). If extra
     command-line arguments (but not -file) are given, then these are
     parsed into events and sent to the proper window. If no event
     sequence is given, then xse creates a tool as specified by the
     "widgets" resource of its application-defaults file. Presumably
     this tool will create Command buttons or menus which will use the
     xse-send() and xse-quit() actions.

     Included in this distribution is the program "ad2c" which
     converts an application-defaults file to C declarations for
     inclusion as fallback resources. Also, the code used to specify
     and create widgets from a resource entry is very modular (see
     translate.c and initWidgets() in xse.c).

     See the file INSTALL for installation instructions.
