.SH NAME
ad2c \- convert resource files to C declarations
.SH SYNOPSIS
.I ad2c
[ files ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.I Ad2c
converts X resource files into C declarations, appropriate for
inclusion as fallback resources.  The program is a
.IR sed (1)
script which is effectively a finite state machine, escaping quotes
and backslashes (and newlines where necessary), and adding quotes and
commas as needed for array initialization.
.LP
It reads from the given files (or stdin if none are given) and writes
the C declarations to stdout.
.SH USAGE
The following example shows a typical use of
.I ad2c
to ensure that an application always has the latest version of its
resources compiled into the executable.  Suppose the application
defaults file is named "Foobar.ad", for application
.IR foobar .
Then the following lines in a Makefile or Imakefile will indicate
how and when to run
.IR ad2c :

.nf
.na
    Foobar.ad.h: Foobar.ad
            ad2c Foobar.ad >Foobar.ad.h
.ad
.fi

The resulting C strings should be included (say in "foobar.c"):

.nf
.na
    static char fallback_resources[] = {
        #include "Foobar.ad.h"
        NULL
    };
.ad
.fi

This array of strings can then be given as a parameter to
.IR XtAppInitialize (3X)
or otherwise used to initialize the application's resources.  Running
.I makedepend
or adding the line

.nf
.na
    foobar.c: Foobar.ad.h
.ad
.fi

to the Makefile or Imakefile will ensure that "foobar.c" is
recompiled when necessary (ie., whenever "Foobar.ad" changes).
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.LP
.I Ad2c
returns as for
.IR sed .
